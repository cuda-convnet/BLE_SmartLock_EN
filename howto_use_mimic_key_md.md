# How to add Online Key
Online Keys are generated from cloud service center, the owner uses their master code to generate Online Keys on cloud service center to allow authorized account to operate.

Online Keys need authority via internet connection, and leave their history record on cloud service.

Online keys can set up weekly recurrence, for example, they can allow a client to open lock every Tuesday 10 to 12 o'clock. For heavily guarded place, you can set the Online Keys to be invalid at night.
