### 4. Remember new Master Code or not
You can choose whether to memorize the master code in current mobile phone or not, then your mobile phone will not need to input master code to enter setting page. You can change this setting in the lock setting page.

**If the original mobile phone is stolen or lost, the lock setting may be changed, we recommend you to setup screen lock**
